# Server-Bot

server-bot is a bot written in javascript using [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js "discord.js library"). It has mostly mod and admin commands but also a whole lot of shitposting commands. If you need help then talk to Jimmy Rustler or Scorpion

### How do I set it up?

If you're the bot hoster for server hub then look [here](https://github.com/Server-Hub-Discord/bot-setup). Download the files and then open first-download.bat, then setup-dependencies.bat and then to update code when Jimmy tells you to update then use update.bat

### Commands

Commands can be viewed by using s!help in any chat

### Great, now how do I use it?
use the commands in the discord server and BAM!

If you have any errors, ask the bot programmers
